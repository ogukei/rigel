YOU (“LICENSEE”) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
THIS AGREEMENT.  If Licensee does not agree to the terms and condition of this
Agreement, THEN do not downLOAD, INSTALL OR USE the SOFTWARE AND MATERIALS.

The materials available for download to Licensees may include software in both

integrated with Licensee software products only to Licensee’s authorized
distributors, resellers, and others in Licensee’s distribution chain for
Licensee product and end users and grant to such third party a sublicense to
use the Software under a written, legally enforceable agreement that has the
effect of protecting the Software and the rights of NVIDIA under terms no less
restrictive than this Agreement.

otherwise assign, sublicense, lease, or in any other way transfer or disclose

costs arising from Licensee’s breach of the foregoing limitations.

NVIDIA may copy, modify, create derivatives works thereof, to use, have used,
import, make, have made, sell, offer to sell, sublicense (through multiple
tiers of sublicensees), distribute (through multiple tiers of distributors)
such derivative work(s) on a stand-alone basis or as incorporated into the

NVIDIA is not prohibited or otherwise restricted from independently developing
new features or functionality with respect to the Licensed Materials

No Other License:No rights or licenses with respect to any proprietary
information or patent, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property
right owned or controlled by NVIDIA are granted by NVIDIA to Licensee under
this Agreement, expressly or by implication, except as expressly provided in
this Agreement. 

Confidentiality: If applicable, any exchange of Confidential Information (as
defined in the NDA) shall be made pursuant to the terms and conditions of a
separately signed Non-Disclosure Agreement (“NDA”) by and between NVIDIA and

form); and (b) Your use of the Software is considered Confidential Information
of NVIDIA.

If You wish to have a third party consultant or subcontractor ("Contractor")

shall obtain a written confidentiality agreement from the Contractor which
contains terms and obligations with respect to access to or use of Software no
less restrictive than those set forth in this Agreement and excluding any

conditions.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Licensee is solely and
exclusively responsible for obtaining any and all authorizations and licenses
required for the use, distribution and/or incorporation of the Third Party

and/or settle any claim, suit or proceeding that is asserted by a third party
against NVIDIA and its officers, employees or agents, to the extent such claim,
suit or proceeding arising from or related to Licensee’s failure to fully
satisfy and/or comply with the third party licensing obligations related to the
Third Party Technology (a “Claim”).  In the event of a Claim, Licensee agrees
